# Quest, Please
## Entry for Gameloop GameJam #01

In **Quest, Please** you are a Quest Giver of an important city of "Generic MMORPG" and the heroes come to you to complete missions, bringing the required items and having back experience, money and stuff.
Players are sly and they'll try to trick you, giving you wrong items, the wrong number of requested items or counterfeit items.
You will have to be careful and approve only those who have brought what was required.
